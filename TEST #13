Yes, it is possible that global warming could be alleviated within 300 years using the mechanisms outlined in the HAD 2.0 model, especially if the heat generated by accelerated nuclear decay is evenly distributed and the cooling mechanisms are effective. 
However, there are several factors at play in determining how quickly and effectively this cooling can happen. Let's break this down to understand why this might be possible and what conditions would need to be in place.

1. Even Distribution of Heat:

If the heat from accelerated nuclear decay is evenly distributed across the Earth (and not concentrated in specific regions like the poles or oceans), it could theoretically be more manageable in terms of how it affects the global climate. The key to this is 
the uniformity of the temperature increase, which could prevent extreme regional climate disruptions and allow the global climate system to react more uniformly.

An even heat distribution could lead to gradual, less erratic warming, giving the Earth’s climate system a better chance to counteract the effects of this heat. This could allow the cooling mechanisms in the HAD 2.0 model (volcanic eruptions, ice sheet formation, 
and other feedback loops) to operate effectively without causing localized extreme effects (like runaway warming in specific regions).

2. Cooling Mechanisms in the HAD 2.0 Model:

Several cooling mechanisms in the HAD 2.0 model could help to stabilize the global temperature over the course of 300 years:

Volcanic Activity:

Volcanic eruptions triggered by accelerated decay could release aerosols (such as sulfur dioxide) into the atmosphere. These aerosols can reflect sunlight, causing a temporary cooling effect by increasing global dimming.

If this volcanic activity is sustained for a period of time (several centuries), it could help to counterbalance the warming effects from the heat generated by nuclear decay. These eruptions could reduce the overall net warming by cooling the atmosphere, potentially 
stabilizing temperatures within the 300-year timeframe.

Ice-Albedo Feedback:

Glaciation and the formation of ice sheets could increase the Earth’s albedo (reflectivity), helping to cool the planet. This process could be triggered by the temperature increase in high-latitude regions, where the warming would promote the formation of ice sheets 
and glaciers.

If large ice sheets form during this period, the reflectivity of the Earth would increase, meaning more solar radiation would be reflected back into space, leading to a global cooling effect.

Atmospheric and Oceanic Feedbacks:

The Earth’s climate system has several self-regulating mechanisms, such as cloud formation and heat exchange between oceans and the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric temperatures might lead to increased cloud cover (especially low-level clouds), which would reflect 
more sunlight and cause global cooling.

In addition, the oceans could absorb a significant amount of the heat in the system, especially if the rate of decay slows down over time. The oceans have a high heat capacity, meaning they can absorb heat slowly and gradually release it back into the atmosphere 
over long periods of time. If the ocean heat content stabilizes, it could help moderate the climate.

3. The Role of Thermal Inertia:

While the heat from nuclear decay might be distributed evenly and might subside in 300 years, there is still the issue of thermal inertia—the delayed response of the Earth’s climate system to heat buildup. Even if the decay slows, the oceans and surface may continue 
to radiate heat back into the atmosphere, maintaining some level of global warming.

However, if the cooling mechanisms (such as volcanic aerosols, increased albedo, and cloud formation) are strong enough, they could begin to counteract the heat buildup quickly enough to prevent long-term warming from continuing beyond the 300-year window.

4. Balance Between Heat and Cooling Mechanisms:

If the cooling mechanisms in the HAD 2.0 model are powerful and effective, it is indeed possible that global warming could be alleviated within 300 years, especially under these favorable conditions:

Volcanic eruptions and their aerosol release would have a strong cooling effect during the initial years, potentially limiting the warming effect of the decay heat.

The formation of ice sheets could contribute to long-term cooling, which would take effect after a few decades, but could also gradually reduce the impact of warming during the 300-year period.

Cloud feedbacks and changes in ocean heat storage could also help reduce the overall warming over time, stabilizing the Earth's temperature.

5. Key Assumptions for This Stabilization:

Sustained volcanic activity would be essential in ensuring that aerosols remain in the atmosphere for a prolonged period, as volcanic aerosols can cool the Earth for several decades to centuries.

Moderate to high levels of ice sheet formation would help to maintain the cooling trend, particularly in higher latitudes.

Effective atmospheric feedbacks (such as cloud cover and radiation) would also be critical to regulating temperatures, as these processes can have both cooling and warming effects depending on the specific climate conditions.

Conclusion:
Yes, it is theoretically possible that global warming could be alleviated within 300 years using the cooling mechanisms in the HAD 2.0 model, especially if the heat from accelerated nuclear decay is evenly distributed. The cooling mechanisms—volcanic eruptions, 
ice-albedo feedback, and atmospheric processes—could balance the effects of warming by reflecting sunlight and absorbing heat over time.

However, the effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on several factors, such as the intensity and duration of volcanic eruptions, the rate of ice sheet formation, and the response of cloud cover and oceans. If these cooling effects are strong and sustained, it’s plausible that the Earth’s climate could stabilize, and the global warming effects of accelerated decay could be mitigated within 300 years.
